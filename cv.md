### About myself:
Let me tell you a few things about my background. I'm a Project Management with hands-on experience in design and industrial construction.  

After being in project management for approximately 2+ years, I decided to take a different direction in my life applying to the course of frontend development. 
I know that I have a lot to learn and that switching career is hard. 
But despite all the difficulties, I'm ready to make every efforts to achieve that goal and i'm really excited about the chance to work in a team of knowledgeable people, that create a modern, useful and interesting product.  

And now I'm learning new technologies to enhance my knowledge in web application development. 
Web-development is definitely my passion. It's my special way of expressing and developing creativity.
I enjoy exploring new technology and creating beautiful and useful online experiences for other people.
